# CNN_Facemask_Detection
The goal of our Face Mask Detection project is to identify based on an image if an individual
wears face mask (medical mask) or not. The last 2 years due to COVID-19 virus, many
governments and particularly the World Health Organization suggest that all individuals
should wear a face mask (medical mask) in order to protect themselves from the virus.
Therefore, a classifier which is trained to classify if an individual wears a mask is very useful
and has many applications nowadays, for example places which is required the face mask such
as Malls or supermarkets.


The classifier has been trained from three different public datasets and combing all the
images together we reach to 12000 unique images.
